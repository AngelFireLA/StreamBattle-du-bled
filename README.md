Simple webapp to make tournaments between images.

To use it, first put all your images in the static/images/ folder (there are already example images for you to test).
Then run app.py and the site is ready to go.


The current round and match number is always shown until the winner.
For each match you will be shown 2 images and you just need to click on who you want to be this match's winner, and then repeat until one image left.
Automatically handles any number of images, even odd ones.
